# CRM + NODE + Angular 1 + MongoDB
Example of companies management, using Node JS and mongo DB, this is an single page application that uses Angular 1 for rendering.

It doesn't have authentication or security at all because the aim of the project is just learning use of Node and mongo

Classes:
- Company: Basic information of the company

Database:
- mongodb

Why angular 1?

I found and downloaded an HTML single page template, angular 1 was the easier way to interact with this template

## TODO
- Registration page as user.
- Login page.
- Main menu.
- Make a UI using a newer version of angular or react.
